# 🎬 Hollywood Actor Salary Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project scrapes and analyzes data on the **highest-paid actors in Hollywood**. Using Python tools like **BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, I transformed raw web data into meaningful visualizations that highlight salary trends across different decades.

The goal wasn’t just to crunch numbers — it was to tell a **story with data**:

* Who are the highest-paid actors?
* How have actor salaries changed over time?
* What patterns emerge when comparing the 1900s, 2000s, and 2010s?

* [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) – for web scraping
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – for data cleaning & manipulation
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – for visualization

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

**Top Paid Actors (Bar Chart):**
Robert Downey Jr. and Will Smith lead with salaries close to **\$40M per film**.

**Actor Salaries Over Time (Line Chart):**
From the 1900s to the 2010s, salaries grew dramatically, with modern salaries dwarfing past earnings.

** Screenshots are provided in this repository's files.


## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Web data is rarely clean — learning to preprocess and structure it is essential.
* Visualization transforms raw numbers into insights that **tell a compelling story**.
* Even fun data (like movie salaries) can be used to demonstrate **real-world data analytics skills**.
